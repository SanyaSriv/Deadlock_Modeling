Router would follow eery inariant but not send a request
3 nodes + 1 router in a ring + bi-drectional.


4 SPACES, we start with 3 tokens each. Only way to get another token
is to 

Local algorithm instead of the global one. We start off with some number
of tokens. If I process a response, then we gain a token. S - 1 tokens. 
There is a cap to the total number of tokens in the
sytem because we have
a local token concept. We need our own token for it. 
Router does not have any tokens because it will never send any request.
